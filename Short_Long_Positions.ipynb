    "**Short position:** When you *sell a security you don't own* at a higher price and *then buy it again at a lower price*. Investors borrow an asset and then sell it on the open market... the price decreases and they are able to buy it at a discount. The investors **keep the difference and return the asset back**.\n",

With long positions, the most you can lose is the price you bought the stock for (initial investment) . However, there is no limit to what you can lose with short positions because there is no limit to how much the stock can increase."
